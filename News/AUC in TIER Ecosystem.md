# AUC in TIER Ecosystem
TIER App was officially launched, and AUC tokens will be available within the app in the first half of 2023, 
when cryptocurrency-related wallet services (transfer and staking) functions are added in TIER App. AUC Token is a native token used
within the AUC ecosystem. In the AUC project ecosystem, the simple payment and remittance TIER App and LEO12 Cryptocurrency Exchange are organically linked,
and all users participating in the ecosystem can easily access crosscountry payments and remittances only with TIER App and Cryptocurrency Exchange, without having to use
multiple solutions to use the AUC token and en-Cash mobile money. Furthermore, AUC Foundation is dedicated to increasing the value of AUC tokens and growing the ecosystem. 
The target market of the AUC project is to target the financially underprivileged across Southern Africa and Asia, starting with South Africa in 2022, and then expanding the ecosystem 
to potential users in the Middle East.
