Did you all know? AUC can be earned through staking. The AUC project has 3 types of staking services!
1. Staking (Loan): This service connects users who stake AUC tokens and users who borrow, generating interest income.
2. Staking (Investment): This service involves staking AUC tokens and investing 
with the AUC Foundation in startup companies that have been selected by the foundation.
3. Staking (Discount): This service involves staking a certain amount of AUC tokens and providing 
different discount benefits based on the staking ratio
