Blockchain refers to a digital ledger of encrypted transaction information shared among members of a public or private network. 

Copies of the transaction ledger are “distributed” to network members and new transactions are authenticated through consensus of the members whenever they occur. 

It is characterized by being based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network system, not relying on centralized systems, and eliminating the need for transaction intermediaries to increase transaction efficiency, transparency, and security at lower costs. 

Advanced Project applies Non-Blockchain technology through en-Cash in its PG system for the expansion of financial payment services, which is designed to be integrated with AUC through the blockchain platform. 

Subsequently, prior to launching its own application services, Advanced Project will develop its original mainnet system and transfer all previous block data and accounts to the newly built mainnet and operate its application services in full synchronization with its own chain.
