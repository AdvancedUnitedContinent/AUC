## Create your first build

> Learn how to create a build for your app with EAS Build.

<br>

EAS Build allows you to build a ready-to-submit binary of your app for the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. In this guide, let's learn how to do that.

Alternatively, if you prefer to install the app directly to your Android device/emulator or install it in the iOS Simulator, we will point you toward resources that explain how to do that.

For a small app, builds for Android and iOS platforms trigger within a few minutes. If you encounter any issues along the way, you can reach out on Discord and Forums.



### 1. Install the latest EAS CLI

`
npm install -g eas-cli
`

### 2. Log in to your Expo account

`
eas login
`

### 3. Configure the project

### 4. Run a build
