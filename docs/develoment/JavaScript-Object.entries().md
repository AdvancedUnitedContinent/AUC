# Object.entries()

> The Object.entries() static method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs.


## Description

- Object.entries() returns an array whose elements are arrays corresponding to the enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs found directly upon object. This is the same as iterating with a for...in loop, except that a for...in loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well. The order of the array returned by Object.entries() is the same as that provided by a for...in loop.

- If you only need the property keys, use Object.keys() instead. If you only need the property values, use Object.values() instead.
