If you're a developer, **you're hearing the term 'design pattern'**. It's important to open up areas of mastery, not just a word you can pass. The diverse, coded patterns are handy tools in software development to improve organization, retention and scalability.

The other design patterns, introduced in 1995 as structural design patterns, will be applied for the first time since then in various places.

In this article, we will look at design patterns and how to use them, and we will explain how to apply these patterns to react functions that we dislike to refine them.

## Understanding Shape Design

Implementing Firebase allows you to hunt other flags before or after running the class's prime.

For example, in the examples mentioned above, you can set up a base station to cache data that handles the main. These proactive caching improves performance, taking into account the high cost.

Data caching outlet design patterns can be useful in a number of ways.

- Security Enhancement: Empower users who are authorized to take security measures such as authentication and authorization.
- Low battery latency: It can withstand traditional services that control load, caching, and employment.
- Network Optimization: In systems of concern, the entrance design scheme can optimize network communication through a remotely operated placeholder role. It helps to affect the delay in communication.
- Share management can withstand sharing that controls access to the router, prevents contention conditions, and maintains data consistency.

The core of the centrifuge is based on a source-based concept, which together sets the unique functions of centrifugation.

It provides a separate hub from other language sources and a very flexible and dynamic way to work with forces.

In the pointer, you can define it as follows.

```
const proxy  =  new Proxy ( focus ,  handler ) ;
```
Target is what light shares, and trying is to include "trap" to God, who tries to take the handler work huge and correct it.

### Usecase
```
const targetObject = {
Message: "Hello, proxy!"
} ;

const handler = {
get : function ( target , prop ) {
console.log ("Property access: ${prop} ');
Return target [prop];
} ,
} ;

const proxy = new proxy (targetObject, handler);
console.log (proxy.message);

// Accessing properties: message
// // Hello, Proxy!
```
